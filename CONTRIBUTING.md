## Submitting Code Contributions

The process for accepting code contributions is as follows:

1.  **Discuss First (Recommended):** For significant changes or new features, it's highly recommended to open an issue first to discuss in the community. This helps ensure your effort aligns with the project's goals and avoids potential rework.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the relevant llm-d repository.
3.  **Create a Branch:** Make your changes in a dedicated branch within your fork.
4.  **Follow Coding Standards:** Adhere to any existing coding style or conventions used in the project.
5.  **Write Tests (if applicable):** If your contribution includes code changes, please include relevant tests.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request to the main repository. Clearly describe the changes you've made and why.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed by the lead core Maintainer. Feedback will be provided, and you may be asked to make revisions. The project leads will ultimately decide whether to merge the pull request based on its alignment with the project's vision, code quality, and overall impact.
