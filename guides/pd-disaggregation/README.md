# Well-lit Path: P/D Disaggregation

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to deploy Llama-70B using vLLM's P/D disaggregation support with NIXL. This guide has been validated on:

* an 8xH200 cluster with InfiniBand networking
* an 8xH200 cluster on GKE with RoCE networking

> WARNING: We are still investigating and optimizing performance for other hardware and networking configurations

In this example, we will demonstrate a deployment of `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-FP8` with:

- 4 TP=1 Prefill Workers
- 1 TP=4 Decode Worker

## P/D Best Practices

P/D disaggregation can benefit overall throughput by:

- Specializing P and D workers for compute-bound vs latency-bound workloads
- Reducing the number of copies of the model (increasing KV cache RAM) with wide parallelism

However, P/D disaggregation is not a target for all workloads. We suggest exploring P/D disaggregation for workloads with:

- Large models (e.g. Llama-70B+, not Llama-8B)
- Longer input sequence lengths (e.g 10k ISL | 1k OSL, not 200 ISL | 200 OSL)
- Sparse MoE architectures with opportunities for wide-EP

As a result, as you tune your P/D deployments, we suggest focusing on the following parameters:

- **Heterogeneous Parallelism**: deploy P workers with less parallelism and more replicas and D workers with more parallelism and fewer replicas
- **xPyD Ratios**: tuning the ratio of P workers to D workers to ensure balance for your ISL|OSL ratio

For very large models leveraging wide-EP, traffic for KV cache transfer may contend with expert parallelism when the ISL|OSL ratio is also high. We recommend starting with RDMA for KV cache transfer before attempting to leverage TCP, as TCP transfer requires more tuning of UCX under NIXL.

## Hardware Requirements

This guide expects 8 Nvidia GPUs of any kind, and RDMA via InfiniBand or RoCE between all pods in the workload.

## Prerequisites

- Have the [proper client tools installed on your local system](../prereq/client-setup/README.md) to use this guide.
- Ensure your cluster infrastructure is sufficient to [deploy high scale inference](../prereq/infrastructure)
- Configure and deploy your [Gateway control plane](../prereq/gateway-provider/README.md).
- [Create the `llm-d-hf-token` secret in your target namespace with the key `HF_TOKEN` matching a valid HuggingFace token](../prereq/client-setup/README.md#huggingface-token) to pull models.

## Installation

Use the helmfile to compose and install the stack. The Namespace in which the stack will be deployed will be derived from the `${NAMESPACE}` environment variable. If you have not set this, it will default to `llm-d-pd` in this example.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=llm-d-pd # Or any namespace your heart desires
cd guides/pd-disaggregation
helmfile apply -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

**_NOTE:_** You can set the `$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX` env variable to change the release names. This is how we support concurrent installs. Ex: `RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX=pd-2 helmfile apply -n ${NAMESPACE}`

**_NOTE:_** This uses Istio as the default provider, see [Gateway Options](./README.md#gateway-options) for installing with a specific provider.

### Gateway options

To see specify your gateway choice you can use the `-e <gateway option>` flag, ex:

```bash
helmfile apply -e kgateway -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

To see what gateway options are supported refer to our [gateway provider prereq doc](../prereq/gateway-provider/README.md#supported-providers). Gateway configurations per provider are tracked in the [gateway-configurations directory](../prereq/gateway-provider/common-configurations/).

You can also customize your gateway, for more information on how to do that see our [gateway customization docs](../../docs/customizing-your-gateway.md).

#### Infrastructure provider specifics

This guide uses RDMA via InfiniBand or RoCE for disaggregated serving kv-cache transfer. The resource attributes required to configure accelerator networking are not yet standardized via [Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/) and so are parameterized per infra provider in the Helm charts. If your provider has a custom setting you will need to update the charts before deploying.

### Install HTTPRoute

Follow provider specific instructions for installing HTTPRoute.

#### Install for "kgateway" or "istio"

```bash
kubectl apply -f httproute.yaml
```

#### Install for "gke"

```bash
kubectl apply -f httproute.gke.yaml
```

## Verify the Installation

- Firstly, you should be able to list all helm releases to view the 3 charts got installed into your chosen namespace:

```bash
helm list -n ${NAMESPACE}
NAME        NAMESPACE   REVISION    UPDATED                                 STATUS      CHART                       APP VERSION
gaie-pd     llm-d-pd    1           2025-08-24 12:54:51.231537 -0700 PDT    deployed    inferencepool-v0.5.1        v0.5.1
infra-pd    llm-d-pd    1           2025-08-24 12:54:46.983361 -0700 PDT    deployed    llm-d-infra-v1.2.4          v0.2.0
ms-pd       llm-d-pd    1           2025-08-24 12:54:56.736873 -0700 PDT    deployed    llm-d-modelservice-v0.2.7   v0.2.0
```

- Out of the box with this example you should have the following resources:

```bash
kubectl get all -n ${NAMESPACE}

```

**_NOTE:_** This assumes no other guide deployments in your given `${NAMESPACE}` and you have not changed the default release names via the `${RELEASE_NAME}` environment variable.

## Using the stack

For instructions on getting started making inference requests see [our docs](../../docs/getting-started-inferencing.md)

## Cleanup

To remove the deployment:

```bash
# Remove the model services
helmfile destroy -n ${NAMESPACE}

# Remove the infrastructure
helm uninstall ms-pd -n ${NAMESPACE}
helm uninstall gaie-pd -n ${NAMESPACE}
helm uninstall infra-pd -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

**_NOTE:_** If you set the `$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX` environment variable, your release names will be different from the command above: `infra-$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX`, `gaie-$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX` and `ms-$RELEASE_NAME_POSTFIX`.

**_NOTE:_** You do not need to specify your `environment` with the `-e <environment>` flag to `helmfile` for removing a installation of the guide, even if you use a non-default option. You do, however, have to set the `-n ${NAMESPACE}` otherwise it may not cleanup the releases in the proper namespace.

### Cleanup HTTPRoute

Follow provider specific instructions for deleting HTTPRoute.

#### Cleanup for "kgateway" or "istio"

```bash
kubectl delete -f httproute.yaml
```

#### Cleanup for "gke"

```bash
kubectl delete -f httproute.gke.yaml
```
