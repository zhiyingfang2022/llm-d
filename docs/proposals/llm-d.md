# llm-d: Kubernetes-native Distributed Inference at Scale

## Summary

Provide a well-lit path for anyone to serve large language models (LLMs) at scale, with the fastest
time-to-value and competitive performance per dollar for most models across most hardware
accelerators. Reduce operational toil for workload owners and inference platform teams by cleanly
integrating with Kubernetes and composing with existing infrastructure choices. Work deeply with
vLLM - the model server with the broadest ecosystem and most accessible extensibility - to rapidly
enable new distributed inference protocols.

## Motivation

Generative AI inference serving for large language models (LLM) is complex at scale and the key techniques enabling that scale are broadly understood but sparsely implemented and yield high operational toil. 

A significant fraction of accelerators that host LLM inference run atop Kubernetes and are managed by inference platform teams who lack a well-lit path to deploy, scale, and customize efficient serving. These teams also seek high capacity utilization of their general purpose models across multiple client workloads including chat, summarization, search, agents, and emerging multimodal applications, all of which exhibit high variance in cost, tolerance of latency, and operational priority.

The high cost of emerging prompt-heavy use cases means that many primary workload serving deployments must optimize multiple parts of the stack, especially prefix caching, to reach both latency and cost objectives. Workload authors need the flexibility to shape their architecture from standard components that do not limit future growth.

### Goals

llm-d is successful if it:

* Provides well-lit paths for anyone to serve LLM at scale
* Brings ML ecosystem expertise into production-ready components for high scale serving
* Provides vLLM-native protocols for distributed inference across multiple accelerator families
* Offers an extensible and flexible inference scheduler to balance traffic
* Supports multiple emerging LLM workloads (agents, multimodal, RAG/search) with clear reference architectures
* Composes with existing Kubernetes infrastructure choices

### Non-Goals

* Prioritize non-Transformer model architectures (initially)
* Fork upstream repositories or carry unmerged upstream changes

## Proposal

The `llm-d` project will start with the [Kubernetes Inference Gateway project (IGW)](github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension) and the [vLLM model server](github.com/vllm-project/vllm) ecosystem to enable the four primary high-scale techniques:

* Tiered prefix cache hierarchy to improve request latency and throughput
* Disaggregated serving to reduce time-to-first-token latency
* LLM-optimized load balancing for better tail latency and workload prioritization and fairness
* Autoscaling for better accelerator efficiency over different hardware and serving configurations

The three initial layers of the runtime infrastructure are:

* Inference Scheduler - apply Kubernetes-native model routing, handle flow control, and orchestrate disaggregation
* vLLM - support point to point disaggregated serving as a native protocol over multiple hardware architectures
* Remote Prefix Cache - separate the operational scaling of replicas from the achievable hit rate

The project will measure success against:

* Achieved scale and performance on key distributed inference workloads
* Efficiency of serving (perf/$ at target latency)
* Reduction of operational toil, especially with increasing workload density

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

As an inference platform team, I can rapidly deploy a shared-nothing serving stack for most LLMs that can be scaled up with prefix caching on both HBM and host memory, fast prefix-cache aware routing, and independently scalable (often called `xPyD`) disaggregated serving. The stack has clear operational metrics and I can measure a significant throughput improvement over round-robin load balancing. The operational and reliability aspects of my stack varies across accelerator hardware only on characteristics tied to the intrinsic hardware, host, and networking configuration.

#### Story 2

As an inference platform team, I can deploy the [DeepSeek R1 inference system](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/open-infra-index/blob/main/202502OpenSourceWeek/day_6_one_more_thing_deepseekV3R1_inference_system_overview.md) in a full xPyD architecture and leverage expert parallelism at peak performance, while being able to reconfigure the stack to a diverse range of traffic distributions using standard Kubernetes primitives.

#### Story 3

As an inference platform team, I can autoscale disaggregated serving roles, different accelerator hardware, and tuned vLLM replicas within a single serving pool to match the current mix of workload traffic, reducing my overall cost to serve and expanding the range of usable capacity.

## Alternatives

### Use NVIDIA Dynamo

NVIDIA Dynamo offers an excellent integrated stack for low-latency and high scale serving. llm-d intends to work closely with the Dynamo team on intergrating components of Dynamo into the operational framework of Kubernetes. We are prioritizing the inference scheduler as the key component to enhance Dynamo.

### Use AIBrix

AIBrix provides a strong research-focused and fast iterating integrated serving platform. llm-d intends to work closely with the AIBrix team to leverage their experience in autoscaling and serving to standardize components and best practices.

### Use Production Stack

production-stack is the easiest way to deploy vLLM on Kubernetes. llm-d intends to work closely with the production-stack team to find common components and patterns to integrate, especially around prefix cache configuration.
