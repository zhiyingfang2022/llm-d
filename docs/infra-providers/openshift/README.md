## Prerequisites

### Platform Setup

- OpenShift - This guide was tested on OpenShift 4.17. Older versions may work but have not been tested.
- NVIDIA GPU Operator and NFD Operator - The installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/steps-overview.html).
- NO Service Mesh or Istio installation as Istio CRDs will conflict with the gateway
